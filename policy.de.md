# User Data Policy

## iobroker.vis User Data policy
We value your privacy, so we want to be explicit about what kind of personal information
is involved when you interact with ioBroker.vis app.

This page is for the iobroker.vis app. The project as such doesn't collect any personally
identifying information from users.

## Collected information
The only information that could be collected from user (according to google) is audio recording if activated.
The app itself does not save or sends anywhere this data except to google voice recognition service.
And it happens only if online speech recognition is enabled. By offline speech recognition no user related
data (voice) will be sent anywhere.
